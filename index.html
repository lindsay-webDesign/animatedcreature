      <h2 style="text-align: center">Goobert the Basketball Player</h2>
      <p> Goobert has been playing basketball since he was a child. He dreams of going into the NBA to persue his basketball dreams. He is smiling because he loves to play b-ball with friends! His arms stretch very long, which makes him an expert at half court shots. His favorite player is Lebron James. </p>
